egpu keep awake program
reports memory useage
does a simple cuda calculation ( vector add )

what it this all about ?

a external gpu - eGPU - is nice to have - if it works properly
configuration and install is at least 5 min , and requires a reboot if it goes to sleep
this is supposed to keep it running

this program is awesome - only crashed once since i made it .... maybe zero
